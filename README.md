Steps To Create Movie App using React Js


1. Set Up the React Project: Start by creating a new React application using create-react-app. This sets up the development environment and provides a basic template to work with.

2. Fetch Movie Data: Use an API like TMDB (The Movie Database) to fetch movie data. You’ll need to obtain an API key and use it to make requests to the API. The fetched data typically includes movie titles, posters, ratings, and descriptions.

3. Create Components: Build React components to display the movie data. Common components include a movie list, movie card, and search box. Each movie card can display the movie poster, title, and other details.

4. Manage State: Use React’s useState hook to manage the state of your movie list and the search term. The useEffect hook can be used to fetch data when the component mounts or the search term changes.
Search Functionality: Implement a search box that allows users to search for movies. Update the movie list based on the search results from the API.

5. Styling: Style your app using CSS or a framework like Bootstrap. You can create a grid layout for the movie list and add effects like hover to show more details about each movie.
